📊 Finance Data Analysis | End-to-End Project

Project Overview:
This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis in the Finance domain, aimed at extracting valuable insights from financial datasets to support data-driven decision-making. Using tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Power BI, the project uncovers key patterns, trends, and correlations in financial data.

📁 Project Workflow

Data Collection:

Gathered real-world financial datasets (bank transactions, customer portfolios, credit risk data, or stock prices).

Performed data integration from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, databases).

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.

Standardized columns and created new derived metrics (e.g., ROI, risk ratios, spending categories).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify financial trends.

Visualized income vs. expenses, profit margins, debt-to-income ratios, and customer segments.

Insights & Visualization:

Designed Power BI dashboards for real-time insights.

Showcased KPIs like Revenue Growth, Investment Returns, and Portfolio Risk Analysis.

Built interactive visuals (filters by year, customer type, and asset class).

Key Findings:

Identified top-performing investment segments.

Analyzed spending patterns that correlate with higher credit risk.

Detected anomalies and potential fraud using statistical indicators.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau
